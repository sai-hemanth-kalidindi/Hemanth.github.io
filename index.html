    <h4>📌 Title & Objective</h4>
    <p>
      This project explores the critical public safety question:  
      <em>Do neighborhoods with higher traffic-related fatalities share specific temporal, spatial, or behavioral risk factors that contribute to elevated fatality rates in NYC?</em><br><br>
      Using over two million crash records from the NYC Vision Zero program, the project investigates how time of day, alcohol involvement, borough location, and road user types influence fatal crash outcomes. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns that can inform more equitable, data-driven traffic safety policies targeting the city’s most vulnerable populations and high-risk areas.

    <h4>📂 Data Source</h4>
    <p>
      Primary dataset: <strong>NYC Open Data – Vision Zero: Motor Vehicle Collisions (Crashes)</strong><br>
      Records: 2,000,000+ (2012–2025)<br>
      Format: CSV<br>
      Fields: crash date/time, borough, number of persons killed/injured, alcohol involvement, vehicle type, road user type
    </p>

    <h4>🧪 Methods & Code Snippets</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Independent Sample T-Test:</strong> Compared fatality rates during 12 AM–6 AM vs. daytime. <em>Result:</em> Fatal crashes significantly more likely at night (p &lt; 0.00001).</li>
      <li><strong>OLS Regression:</strong> Modeled fatality count with predictors like alcohol, borough, time, and interactions (e.g., NIGHT × ALCOHOL).</li>
      <li><strong>Chi-Square Test:</strong> Assessed association between risky behaviors (e.g., failure to yield, alcohol use) and fatal crashes.</li>
      <li>Code and data in Python (pandas, statsmodels, seaborn) via Google Colab.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>📊 Key Insights</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time of Day Matters:</strong> Fatal crashes are significantly more likely to occur between 12 AM and 6 AM, driven by low visibility, driver fatigue, and increased impaired driving (T-test p-value &lt; 0.00001).</li>
      <li><strong>Alcohol Use is Deadly:</strong> Crashes involving alcohol are strongly associated with higher fatality rates. This was validated using both OLS regression and Chi-Square tests.</li>
      <li><strong>Spatial Disparities:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Brooklyn and Queens report the highest number of fatalities overall.</li>
          <li>Midtown Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn are high-risk zones for fatal crashes, as shown in heatmaps and cluster maps.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Vulnerable Road Users:</strong> Pedestrians make up over 50% of all traffic fatalities, highlighting the urgent need for improved crosswalks, signage, and public awareness.</li>
      <li><strong>Seasonal Trends:</strong> Fatalities peak during summer months, especially August, and drop during colder months. This suggests a need for seasonal enforcement strategies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>💭 Reflections</h4>

    <h5>💡 What Was Challenging:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> Handling over 2 million records required filtering for accuracy and relevance, especially around missing borough names and inconsistent timestamps.</li>
      <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Creating binary indicators (e.g., IS_NIGHT, ALCOHOL_INVOLVED) and interaction terms added complexity to the regression modeling.</li>
      <li><strong>Geospatial Analysis:</strong> Creating cluster maps that meaningfully represented fatality hotspots took several iterations and experimentation with mapping libraries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>🏁 What Was Rewarding:</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Seeing statistically significant patterns emerge that aligned with real-world traffic risks.</li>
      <li>Turning raw data into actionable insights that can inform urban safety policy.</li>
      <li>Building a complete end-to-end workflow from hypothesis to visualization in Google Colab and Python.</li>
    </ul>
